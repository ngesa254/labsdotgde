# ADK LABS: Building AI Agents with Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK)

Welcome! In this workshop, we‚Äôll guide you from the fundamentals of agent development to creating and deploying powerful, intelligent AI agents on Google Cloud.

## How to Make the Most of This Workshop

- **Pair up:** Collaboration makes the challenges faster and more fun.
- **Learn at your own pace:** Pick the challenges that interest you. It's fine not to finish all of them.
- **Celebrate progress:** Completing even one challenge is a win.
- **Ask for help:** In-person? Stuck for more than 20 seconds‚Äîraise your hand and we'll help.

These challenges are designed for exploration rather than step-by-step instructions. You‚Äôre encouraged to use all available resources to figure things out:

- Search the [ADK documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/) and explore the [adk-samples](https://github.com/google/adk-samples) repository.
- I also have another repository with example solutions to some of the challenges ‚Äî resist the temptation to peek until you‚Äôve tried solving them yourself!
- Most challenges will require a Google Cloud Project.  
  - In our in-person workshops, you can use the free $5 credit on the Google Cloud free tier (no credit card needed).  
  - Be aware of rate limits and quotas.

## Lesson 1: ADK Fundermentals

Get started with Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)
Empower ADK agents with tools

### 1.1 Local Setup & "Hello, Agent!"
üìÅ `Lessons/adk-intro/01-local-setup.md`  
Set up your environment and run the Dev UI.

### 1.2 Your First Tool // Empower ADK agents with tools.

üìÅ `Lessons/adk-intro/02-first-tool.md`  
Add a practical tool (`get_weather`) and see tool calls in the Trace view.

### 1.3 Multiple Tools ‚Äî "City Status"
üìÅ `Lessons/adk-intro/03-multiple-tools-city-status.md`  
Add `get_city_fact` and learn routing / combining outputs.

### 1.4 Your First Cloud Deployment
üìÅ `Lessons/adk-intro/04-first-cloud-deployment.md`  
Publish to Cloud Run with `adk deploy cloud_run --with_ui`.

## Lesson 2: Build multi-agent systems with ADK

This workshop covers orchestrating multi-agent systems within the Google Agent Development Kit (Google ADK).

This workshop assumes that you are familiar with the basics of ADK and tool use as covered in the lesson 1.

In this workshop, you will:

- Create multiple agents and relate them to one another with parent to sub-agent relationships
- Build content across multiple turns of conversation and multiple agents by writing to a session's state dictionary
- Instruct agents to read values from the session state to use as context for their responses
- Use workflow agents to pass the conversation between agents directly

### 2.1. Convert function calling agents into ADK Tools...

## Lesson 3: Multi Agent Systems with ADK and MCP

## Lesson 4: Multimodal Streaming Agents with ADK and Gemini Live API
