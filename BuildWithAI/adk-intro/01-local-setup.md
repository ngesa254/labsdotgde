# Challenge: Local Setup & "Hello, Agent!"
Set up your local development environment and run the basic agent.

## Concept
The first step is to set up your local development environment and run the basic, pre-generated agent to understand the core workflow.

## Prerequisites
*   Optional: The [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) Python package manager.

## Task
Use `adk create demo` to generate agent source code and `adk web` to launch the local web UI. If you're using `uv`, getting started with a project is two steps: run `uv init` and `uv add google-adk`.

## Outcome
You have the ADK web UI running on your machine, allowing you to chat with your first, simple agent.

## Question
The `adk web` command starts a server. Explore the UI and find out what all the tabs do.
