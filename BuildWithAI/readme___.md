# ADK LABS: Building AI Agents with Google’s Agent Development Kit (ADK)

Welcome! In this workshop, we’ll guide you from the fundamentals of agent development to creating and deploying powerful, intelligent AI agents on Google Cloud.

## How to Make the Most of This Workshop

- **Pair up:** Find a buddy to work with — collaboration makes the challenges faster and more fun.
- **Learn at your own pace:** You don’t need to complete every challenge. Pick the ones that interest you. If you can’t finish, no worries — you can always continue later.
- **Celebrate progress:** Completing even one challenge is a win.
- **Ask for help:** For in-person attendees — if you’re stuck for more than 20 seconds, raise your hand and we’ll help you get back on track.
