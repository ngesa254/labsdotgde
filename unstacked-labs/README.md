# Building Gen AI Solutions with the Vertex AI SDK

## Introduction

### Overview

You are a developer at a travel marketing company. Your sales department has decided that they need a new chat application to keep up with the bigger booking and search companies. They've also heard about generative AI, but they don't know that much about it. Other departments have heard about this initiative, and they're curious how this might also help their customer experience.

### What You'll Do

In this lab, you will build a travel assistant chatbot using the Gemini 2.5 Flash model on Vertex AI.

The application should:

- Help users ask questions about travel, book travel, and learn about places to which they are planning to go.
- Provide users ways to get help about their specific travel plans.
- Be able to fetch real-time data, like weather, using tools.

You'll be working in a pre-configured Google Cloud environment, specifically within the Cloud Shell Editor. A basic web application frontend is already set up for you, along with the necessary permissions to access Vertex AI. This app has been built using Streamlit.

### What You'll Learn

In this lab, you learn how to perform the following tasks:

- Explore the Vertex AI platform to identify available generative AI models.
- Develop in the Cloud Shell Editor and terminal.
- Utilize Gemini Code Assist to understand code.
- Use the Vertex AI SDK in Python to send prompts to and receive responses from a Gemini LLM.
- Apply basic prompt engineering (system instructions, model parameters) to customize a Gemini LLM's output.
- Test and iteratively refine an LLM-powered chat application by modifying prompts and parameters to improve responses.
- Define and use tools with the Gemini model to enable function calling.
- Refactor code to use a stateful chat session, a best practice for conversational apps.
