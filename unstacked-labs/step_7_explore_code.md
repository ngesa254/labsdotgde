## Understanding Your Starter Files

The files you created include a basic chat application frontend. They include:

### `app.py`

This is the file we will be working in. It currently contains the following:

- **Necessary imports** - Libraries required for the application
- **Environment variables and parameters** - Some of which are placeholders that you'll fill in
- **An empty `call_model` function** - Which we'll be filling in throughout the lab
- **Streamlit code** - For the front-end chat app interface

### `requirements.txt`

- Includes the installation requirements for running `app.py`
