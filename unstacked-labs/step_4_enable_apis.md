# Enable APIs

## Overview

To use the Vertex AI SDK and interact with the Gemini model, you need to enable the Vertex AI API in your Google Cloud project.

## Enable the Vertex AI API

1. In the terminal, enable the APIs:

   ```shell
   gcloud services enable \
     aiplatform.googleapis.com
   ```

## Introduction to the Vertex AI SDK for Python

To interact with models hosted on Vertex AI from your Python application, you'll use the **Vertex AI SDK for Python**. This SDK simplifies the process of sending prompts, specifying model parameters, and receiving responses without needing to handle the complexities of the underlying API calls directly.

### Documentation

You can find comprehensive documentation for the Vertex AI SDK for Python here:
