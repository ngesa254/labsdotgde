# Challenge: Your First Cloud Deployment
Deploy your agent as a web app on Cloud Run.

## Prerequisites
*   A [Google Cloud project](https://console.cloud.google.com/) with billing enabled.
*   An [ADK project]([ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/getting-started/installation)) with a sample agent.

## Concept
Make your agent accessible to the world by deploying it as a web app on Cloud Run.

## Task
Use the `adk deploy cloud_run --with_ui` command to deploy the tool-using agent from the previous challenge.

## Outcome
You will have a public URL that serves the same ADK web UI and the agent you just built.

## Question
Does it make sense to deploy the ADK web UI to a production endpoint? How would you integrate ADK into your application?
